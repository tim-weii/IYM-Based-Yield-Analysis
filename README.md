#  Intelligent Yield Management (IYM) ‚Äî Key-Variable Search for Yield Loss Analysis  
## Background  

In advanced manufacturing, **yield directly affects cost and competitiveness**.  


In manufacturing data, anomalies can generally be divided into two categories:  

1. **Point-wise Anomaly**  
   - Refers to a single data point that significantly deviates from its neighbors.  
   - Such anomalies are isolated and discontinuous, and do not follow the normal trend of the dataset.  
   - Example:  
   <p align="center">
<img width="500" alt="Ëû¢ÂπïÊì∑ÂèñÁï´Èù¢ 2025-09-21 225915" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fed0e3a8-69d8-44fa-b006-50f27e2489b7" />
   </p>  

2. **Pattern-wise Anomaly**  
   - Refers to a sequence of data points over a certain time interval that deviates from the expected overall pattern.  
   - Unlike point anomalies, pattern anomalies reflect abnormal relationships or variations across multiple data points.  
   - Typically continuous and span across a time window.  
   - Example:  
   <p align="center">
<img width="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c32fd472-482d-444a-ad6d-c550e7e0d658" />
   </p>

Traditional yield analysis mainly relies on **historical pattern matching**.  
However, under **high-dimensional conditions (p ‚â´ n)** ‚Äî where process parameters far exceed available samples ‚Äî such methods often fail to identify the **true root causes**.  

To address this, I introduce **Intelligent Yield Management (IYM)** with the **Key-Variable Search Algorithm (KSA)**.

## Case Study 

In real manufacturing cases, **it is often difficult to visually distinguish process differences**.  
The figure below shows one of the **most obvious cases**, yet even here the variations are subtle and cannot be reliably judged by the naked eye.

**Figure 2.** Raw process data ‚Äî this example was deliberately selected as one of the clearest cases, with problematic regions highlighted in red. Even so, proper classification still requires algorithmic analysis rather than visual inspection alone.

---

To address this challenge, I applied **unsupervised clustering methods** to reveal hidden patterns in the data:  

- **K-means Clustering & DBSCAN Clustering**  

<p align="center">
<img width="800" height="500" alt="Ëû¢ÂπïÊì∑ÂèñÁï´Èù¢ 2025-09-20 221608" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23a958b1-4029-4de0-9261-268d34ee0580" />
</p>

### Limitations of K-means:
Assumes spherical clusters and performs poorly on non-linear boundaries.
Highly sensitive to initial centroid selection, often leading to local optima.
Requires pre-defined number of clusters (k), which is unknown in high-dimensional process data.

### Limitations of DBSCAN:
Extremely sensitive to parameter settings (Œµ neighborhood size, minPts).
Struggles with datasets of varying density, often misclassifying normal points as noise.
In high-dimensional data, distance metrics become less meaningful (‚Äúcurse of dimensionality‚Äù), leading to distorted clustering results.

### What IYM Does  

Traditional yield analysis mainly relies on **historical pattern matching**.  
However, under **high-dimensional conditions (p ‚â´ n)** ‚Äî where process parameters far exceed available samples ‚Äî such methods often fail to identify the **true root causes**.  

To address this, I introduce **Intelligent Yield Management (IYM)** with the **Key-Variable Search Algorithm (KSA)**.  

<p align="center" style="background-color:white; display:inline-block; padding:10px;">
<img width="1633" height="703" alt="Ëû¢ÂπïÊì∑ÂèñÁï´Èù¢ 2025-09-19 144409" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bb9d97e-9c58-4a52-bd06-f73afb41bbb8" />

##  Methodology (KSA Framework)  
The **KSA scheme** combines greedy search and sparse regression to identify critical process variables:  

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Align production routes (XR), process parameters (XP), inline inspection data (y), and final yield (Y).  
   - Normalize, clean, and organize batch/tool-level information.  

2. **Key-Variable Search (KSA Module)**  
   - In our approach, **Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)** is first applied to transform time-series signals into the time‚Äìfrequency domain, allowing us to capture dynamic process patterns.  
   - Instead of directly relying on traditional variable selection algorithms (e.g., TPOGA, ALASSO), STFT-based features are extracted to highlight critical variations in process behavior that may contribute to yield loss.  

3. **Reliance Index (RIK)**  
   - Measures the confidence of identified parameters/features.  
   - RIK > 0.7 = high confidence in the extracted factors.  

---

##  Two-Phase Search Process  

1. **Phase I ‚Äî Suspicious Stage/Tool Identification**  
   - Input: (Y, y, XR)  
   - Output: Top-N suspicious tools/stages with RIK confidence scores.  

2. **Phase II ‚Äî Parameter Drill-Down**  
   - Input: (Y, XP) for the selected stage.  
   - Output: Key process parameters (e.g., coating speed, viscosity) with coefficient values & RIK scores.  

---

##  Why ALASSO?  

- **Handles p ‚â´ n:** Works in high-dimensional cases with limited defect samples.  
- **Sparsity assumption:** Selects only the true root-cause subset.  
- **Interpretability:** Keeps variable identity (vs PCA/PLS latent features).  
- **Improved stability:** Reweighted coefficients ‚Üí less bias & better handling of correlated variables.  

 Compared to black-box ML models, **ALASSO provides interpretable engineering insights**, essential for process improvement.

### Case Study: Paper Coating Defects (2023)

After a series of data preprocessing, statistical testing (e.g., t-test), and applying the IYM framework with the **Key-Variable Search Algorithm (KSA)**, we were able to pinpoint suspicious variables that differentiate **Normal** from **Abnormal** coating results.

The figure below illustrates one sample case.  
- **Blue curve (Normal data)** shows the expected process trend over time.  
- **Red curve (Abnormal data)** highlights the detected anomaly.  
- The abnormal segment deviates significantly from the normal trend, confirming the **root-cause signal** that contributes to coating defects.

</p>
<p align="center">Fig. X. Example of Normal vs. Abnormal data after IYM + KSA analysis. The abnormal segment (red) is clearly separated and identified as problematic.</p>

This demonstrates that the IYM + KSA approach not only narrows down the **critical sensors/variables** but also provides **visual evidence** of where abnormalities occur, enabling engineers to take corrective actions in production.


##  Contributions

- Developed a **two-phase KSA workflow** (stage ‚Üí parameter).  
- Introduced **RIK index** for reliability assessment.  
- Successfully applied to **TFT-LCD coating defect analysis**, revealing true process root causes.

## üìä Case Study: Coating Defects in Paper Manufacturing (2023)

In this case study, we analyze **coating defects** in the paper manufacturing process.  
Customer complaints showed a surge in coating-related issues in **2023 (5 cases)** compared to only **1 case in 2022**.  
To investigate, we applied **Intelligent Yield Management (IYM)** with both **exploratory data analysis** and **statistical testing**.

---

### 1) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Production data was divided into **Normal (good)** and **Abnormal (defective)** groups.  
Scatter plots, histograms with KDE, and boxplots were used to visualize differences.

üì∑ **[Fig.1] Scatter / Histogram / Boxplot of Normal vs Abnormal Data**

- Scatter plot: Values overlap heavily but some deviations are visible.  
- Histogram: Abnormal data shows tighter clustering / shifts in distribution.  
- Boxplot: Abnormal group median differs noticeably from Normal.  

---

### 2) Statistical Testing (t-test)
To validate observed differences, we applied **Student‚Äôs t-test** to each parameter.

üìã **[Table 1] t-test results (parameters anonymized as XXX, YYY)**

| col_name | statistic | p_value   | Significant (p<0.05) |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------------------|
| **XXX**  | 348.20    | 1.28E-77  | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **YYY**  | 2.02      | 0.154     | ‚ùå No  |

**Interpretation**:  
- **XXX** shows a highly significant difference (p ‚âà 1.28E-77), strongly linked to coating defects.  
- **YYY** shows no significant difference and can be excluded from further investigation.  

---

### 3) Findings
- Pure visual inspection can be misleading ‚Äî statistical validation ensures more reliable results.  
- **XXX** is a strong candidate parameter for further engineering validation (e.g., coating pressure, viscosity, bake curve).  
- **YYY** can be deprioritized, saving time and analysis resources.
